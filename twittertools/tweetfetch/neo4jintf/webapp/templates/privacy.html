<p>We will not use any of your sensitive personal information for a purpose other than its original purpose for which we collected it or the purpose authorized subsequently by you, unless you have provided opt-in consent.  </p>

<h2>Choice</h2>
<p>You have the ability to “opt-out” or unsubscribe from continuing to receive any Neo Technology marketing communications via email atwebinfo@neotechnology.com at any time. Neo Technology also provides opt-out information in all marketing communications via an “unsubscribe” link in communication emails, which directly unsubscribes you from any further communication from Neo Technology.</p>

<h2>Cookies and Tracking Data</h2>
<p>We may use small text files called cookies and other tracking mechanisms to improve overall Site experience. We use both session ID cookies and persistent cookies on our Site. A session ID cookie expires when you close your browser. A persistent cookie remains on your hard drive for an extended period of time.</p>

<p>To learn more about the cookies and other tracking mechanisms that we use, please see our <a href="/cookies">[Cookie and Tracking Policy]</a>.</p>


<h2>Aggregate Information</h2>
<p>The Site collects information about the use of the Site that is maintained, used and disclosed in aggregate form only and which will not contain your personally identifiable information, for example, without limitation, the total number of visitors to our Site, the number of visitors to each page of our Site, browser type, External Web Sites (defined below) linked to and IP addresses. We may analyze this data for trends and statistics in the aggregate, and we may use such aggregate information to administer and improve the Site, track users’ movement, and gather broad demographic information for aggregate use.</p>

<h2>Disclosure</h2>
<p>We may provide your personally identifiable information and the data generated by cookies and the aggregate information to the vendors and service agencies that we may engage to assist us in providing our services to you for their use solely to provide us with such assistance. Unless we give you the choice to opt-out and you do not exercise your opt-out right, Neo Technology’s service providers do not have any right to use personal information we share with them beyond what is necessary to assist us or for a purpose incompatible with the purpose for which it was originally collected or subsequently authorized by you. We will not disclose your sensitive or other personal information to a third party unless you have provided us with affirmative or explicit (opt in) consent.</p>

<p>We will also disclose your personally identifiable information (a) if we are required to do so by law, regulation or other government authority or otherwise in cooperation with an ongoing investigation of a governmental authority, (b) to enforce the Neo Technology Terms of Use agreement or to protect our rights or (c) to protect the safety of users of our Site and our services. We will not sell your personally identifiable information to any company or organization, but we may transfer your personally identifiable information to a successor entity upon a merger, consolidation or other corporate reorganization in which Neo Technology participates or to a purchaser or acquirer of all or substantially all of Neo Technology’s assets to which this Site relates.</p>

<h2>Links to Third Party Sites</h2>
<p>The Site may provide links to other Web sites or resources over which Neo Technology does not have control (“External Web Sites”).  For example, our pages at GoogleGroups and Stackoverflow are External Web Sites. Such links do not constitute an endorsement by Neo Technology of those External Web Sites. You acknowledge that Neo Technology is providing these links to you only as a convenience, and further agree that Neo Technology is not responsible for the content of such External Web Sites. Your use of External Web Sites is subject to the terms of use and privacy policies located on the linked to External Web Sites.</p>

<h2>Social Plugins on Our Site </h2>
<p>We may use social plugins on our Site and may include icons that allow you to interact with third party social networks such as LinkedIn, Twitter and Facebook.  For example, you may “like” us or a book on Facebook or follow us or Tweet about us on Twitter.  The third party social plugin may set a cookie when your browser creates a connection to the servers of such social networks and the plugin may transmit your data to the social networks.  </p>

<p>Additionally, there may be places where we offer the ability for Neo4j applications to connect with third party social networks, such as Twitter or Facebook.  We will collect certain data that the third party social networks provide to us and we will only use that data to provide the application for your use.</p>

<p>Your use of these social plugins is subject to the privacy policies of the third party social networks.</p>

<h2>Security</h2>
<p>We may employ procedural and technological measures, consistent with industry practice. Such measures are reasonably designed to help protect your personally identifiable information from loss, unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration or destruction. Neo Technology may use secure socket layer and other security measures to help prevent unauthorized access to your personally identifiable information.</p>

<h2>Accessing and Updating Personally Identifiable Information</h2>
<p>Neo Technology allows an individual access to their personally identifiable information and allows the individual to correct, amend or delete inaccurate information, except where the burden or expense of providing access would be disproportionate to the risks to the privacy of the individual in the case in question or where the rights of persons other than the individual would be violated.  Neo Technology provides you with the ability to review and update the registration information that you provide to us by contacting us at webinfo@neotechnology.com. </p>

<h2>Questions</h2>
<p>If you have any questions regarding this Privacy Policy please contact us via email at webinfo@neotechnology.com. </p>

<h2>Notice to Users Outside of the United States of America</h2>
<p> Any information you enter on this Site may be transferred outside of the country in which you are located to the United States of America which does not offer an equivalent level of protection to that required in other countries, such as the European Union. In particular, you are advised that the United States of America uses a sectoral model of privacy protection that relies on a mix of legislation, governmental regulation, and self-regulation. Article 26 of the European Union’s Data Protection Directive (Directive 95/46/EC, 1995 O.J. (L 281) 31) allows for transfer of personal data from the European Union to a third country if the individual has unambiguously given his consent to the transfer of personally identifiable information, regardless of the third country’s level of protection. By using this Site or the services, you consent to the transfer of all such information to the United States of America which may not offer an equivalent level of protection to that required in the European Union and to the processing of that information by Neo Technology on its servers located in the United States of America as described in this Privacy Policy.</p>

<h2>Privacy Policy Updates</h2>
<p>Due to the Internet’s rapidly evolving nature, Neo Technology may need to update this Privacy Policy from time to time. If so, Neo Technology will post our updated Privacy Policy on our Site along with notice that the Privacy Policy has been changed so you are always aware of what personally identifiable information we may collect and how we may use this information. Neo Technology may also send registered users of the Site e-mail notifications notifying such users of any material changes to the Privacy Policy. Neo Technology encourages you to review this Privacy Policy regularly for any changes. Your continued use of this Site and/or continued provision of personally identifiable information to us will be subject to the terms of the then-current Privacy Policy.</p>
